Feedback Rating Form

This code represents a feedback rating form implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form allows users to provide feedback on a support request and rate their experience on a scale of 1 to 5.
HTML Structure

The HTML code defines the structure of the rating form. It consists of two main sections:

    The main section with the class active, which represents the active state of the form where users can select their rating.
    The main section with the class submit_section hidden, which represents the submitted state of the form where users see a thank you message and their selected rating.

CSS Styling

The CSS code styles the elements of the rating form. It imports fonts from Google Fonts and applies various styles to achieve the desired layout and appearance.
JavaScript Interactivity

The JavaScript code adds interactivity to the rating form. It selects all the rating buttons, listens for a click event on each button, and updates the selected rating. When the submit button is clicked, it checks if a rating has been selected. If a rating is available, it hides the active state and shows the submitted state of the form.

The JavaScript code relies on classes and IDs defined in the HTML code to manipulate and update the form elements dynamically.

Please note that this code assumes the presence of the script.js file in the same directory as the HTML file, which contains the JavaScript code.

Feel free to modify and enhance this code according to your requirements.
